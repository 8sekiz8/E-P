    <h1>Elevator Pitch</h1>
    <br />
    <div>
      I'm Esin Gencel, a junior web developer with experience in JavaScript
      frameworks and currently an engineering student in Energy Systems. I am
      currently participating to a Front-end bootcamp in Re:Coded and working as
      a paragliding instructor besides. I have a quite multidisciplinary
      background in very different sectors and I truely believe that those
      experiences have given me a different point of view. I had a nomadic style
      of life during my childhood because of my family. I guess living in
      different cities countries, being a part of different cultures and
      lifestyles made me an open person to any kind of challenge. Learning new
      things have been a passion for me through my life and as a junior
      developer, I feel like coding is going to be my new playground. If you're
      excited like me, why don't you send me an email?
